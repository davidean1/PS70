#### Week 1: Introduction 

<p>For this week I considered what final projects I wanted to work on. Furthermore, I made my website functional and customized it. I first made the home page 2 columns and 6 rows and I added a finakl project tab to the top of the website. To customize colors and this layout I used w3schools to research bootstrap, html, and css</p>

<p><storng>Image displaying sweatshirt:</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Through the use of electronics and image processing I want to take a user inputed image and perform image processesing on it and send it to an arduino to display that image on leds that are crocheted into a sweatshirt the idea is a sweatshirt that lights up and can display any image. some challanges include fabrication of the sweatshirt this will likely involve crocheting. Futhermore powering the sweatshirt is also a challange that needs to be considered I am planning on using python for image processing and performing wireless communication with the arduino this will require research into wireless communication and the creation of a power source (I will work on this project with someone else if they would like to join)</p>

<p><storng>Marble sorting machine:</strong></p>
<br>
<p>I would like to make a machine that can sort marbles. Ideally the user would pour in a bunch of marbles and the machine would be able to take and seperate on marble at a time. to do this it will require fabrication of the machine body and it will require analyzing the marbles the marbles will be made of different materials. To make this I will need sensors to analyze light passing through the marble/ color and weight. I will need to characterize each marble, and I will need a mechanisim that only allows one marble through at a time. Finally I will need a mechanisim to transport the marble to the correct container. This poroject is inspired by an assignment given to me in my highschool engineering class which ultimately failed.</p>
