#### Week 2: Laser cutting

<p>
This week I started to learn about Fusion 360 and laser cutting for the assignment I had to do a fusion 360 tutorial, create a press fit kit and laser cut it,
and model two household items in fusion 360.

For the tutorial I decided to follow the basic one on the PS70 website in this tutorial I created an example of the press fit kit. I learned basic controls of fusion 360
such as panning and moving around. I then learned how to create basic shapes and cxreate sketches. I then learned about offsets. After doing offsets I learned about consturction lines
construction luines are helpful for things like mirroring and useful to perform geometric functions without being included in the shape of the object. I then learned about
mirroring which can help with symmetry and allows the creation of objects to be speed up. Furthermore I learned aboyut parameters which function like variables in programming allowing me to use the valus in several locations
and then having the ability to change the value in one spot so I dont have to change the value in each dimension its used it. After this I learned how to extrude sketches and then
use those objects in assemblies to visualize several parts coming together into one object. Pictured below is the resulting object after following the tutorial.

The first thing I wanted to do was use calipers to measure the material thickness because this is one of the critical dimensions I will need I measured the thickness to be around 4.2 mm
I made a parameter for material thickness as well as a paramater for kerf. For each connection slot I used a consturction line for the middle and then made an offset line
the offset is material thickness divided by 2 minus kerf. This is because I will be mirroring the line so the line needs to be half of the material thickness away but It will be a little
less because I will loose some material due to the kerf so that is where the minus kerf term comes from. I then mirrored this offset line over the construction line to get the whole notch
This is the process I used to create every notch.
