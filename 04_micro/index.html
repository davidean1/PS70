#### Week 4: Micro Controller

<p>
This week I learned about microcontrollers and microcontroller programming
</p>
<br>

<p><storng>initial idea</strong></p>
<br>
<p>
I did not want to continue working on last weeks project so I camed up with a new idea I wanted to practice using analog inputs and outpputs so I decided to make 
a device that detects a hand above it and plays different music depending on the location of the hand.
</p>



<br>
<p><storng>prototype</strong></p>
<br>
<p>
Before jumping into creating this I wanted to make a simple prototype to see if my idea would be viable. 
To do this I researched what input devices would be useful and I came across photoresistors. These devices decrease resistance depending on the level of light that reaches it.
This means that when a hand comes across it the resistance increases and the voltage drop increases across the photoresistor.
For this to work I needed to wire up the photoresistor in series with a set value resistor at first I 
Chose a 1k Ohm resistor and wired up the output to ground and a wire in parallel that goes into the analog input for the arduino. I then wired an output to an led and wrote some code that reads the value from the photoresistor and if its less than a certain value it lights up the LED to get this value I had to run the code and test the input values by printing them into the serial console and I used that data to tune the values in the code

As you can see from the gif, sometimes the input has trouble detecting my finger. I needed to improve this in order to achieve my desired output. When I was looking at the serial output console I noticed that sometimes the values were noisy. I couldn't fix the issue in my code so I had to change my circuit. My initial idea was to change the only thing I really could without altering my idea. I had to change the resistance value of the resistor connected to the photoresistor. I replaced the 1kOhm resistor with a 20kOhm resistor. I ran the code and did the same tests to configure the right values for my if statement in my code to tune it to my input. I then ran the code again and performed the same test these were the results.
