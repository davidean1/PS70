#### Week 11: Final Remarks
<p>
Overall in this class I learned a lot of the skills of digital fabrication, and Learned a lot about integrating electronic, mechanical, and software aspects into one final project
</p>
<br>

<p><storng>The takeaways</strong></p>
<br>
<p>
I learned a lot about mechanical aspects and fabrications processes which were the skills I was laking coming into the course I now feel confident about fabricating and I feel confident integrating mechanical and electrical components into one project which is a skill that I had no experince with coming into this course
</p>


<p><storng>The future</strong></p>

<p>
I am going to keep developing my fabrication skills including PCB design, furthuremore, I am going to keep working on my final project and make changes to it and I plan on doing more projects that integrate multiple challanging aspects. I want to keep developing this portfolio and change the look of it to make it look nicer.
